# FISA_Mini_Project
I have set up an ELK pipeline on Windows and then built another ELK pipeline on a virtual machine using Ubuntu. I utilized dummy data to perform the analysis.
During the setup, the connection to ElasticSearch was not smooth, and the connection between Filebeat and Logstash was also not seamless. When the connections failed, I used Nginx to facilitate the connections, and I continuously modified the yml files for Filebeat and Logstash to ensure smooth connectivity.
